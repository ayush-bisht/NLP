Just run the cells for all the colab files to get the associated results.
For qa_testing:
Make sure the following file/dir paths are adjusted according to file locations.
file- augmented_dev.json (augmented dev set)
dir- bert-base-uncased and distilbert-base uncased (models and predictions are stored in these directories)

The default directory is "/content/drive/My Drive/nlp_dataset"
The above file and directories are assumed to be inside this directory.
(For the exisiting configuration, just upload the nlp_dataset folder in your drive and run the file as is.)
